# Karplus-Strong Note Generator
Generates music notes using the Karplus-Strong algorithm. The notes are generated with the Hz values, and sound 
identical to MIDI guitar notes. 

Certain parts of the main function still contain some bugs. Folder paths can be changed as necessary. Everything can be 
run from the terminal using Argparse.
